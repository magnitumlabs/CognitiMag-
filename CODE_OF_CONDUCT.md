# Code of Conduct — CognitiMag (AI-Cognitive Coach for ADHD & ASD)

> This project aims to build trustworthy, privacy-preserving, and accessible assistive technology. We expect all community members to act with respect and care for neurodiverse users and contributors.

## Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Respecting differing opinions, experiences, and backgrounds
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for users (especially neurodiverse users) and the community
- Using inclusive, accessible language and clear documentation

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, trolling, or insulting/derogatory comments
- Publishing others’ private information (doxing) without explicit permission
- Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Sustained disruption of discussions, reviews, or community events
- Dismissing privacy, safety, or accessibility concerns raised in good faith

## Responsibilities of Maintainers
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. They may remove, edit, or reject contributions (code, issues, comments, documentation) that are not aligned with this Code, and may temporarily or permanently ban contributors for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code applies within all project spaces—GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, reviews, and community channels—as well as when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at **conduct@<your-domain>** (replace with a monitored address). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

- We will respect the reporter’s privacy and handle reports confidentially to the extent possible.
- If a conflict of interest exists (e.g., a maintainer is involved in the incident), the report will be handled by an uninvolved maintainer or external advisor.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code:

### 1. Correction
**Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome by the community.  
**Consequence:** A private, written warning from maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Impact:** A single incident or series of actions that create or risk creating a negative environment.  
**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code, for a specified period. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.  
**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. During this time, no public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code, is allowed. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, sustained harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.  
**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any interaction with the community.

## Reporting Guide (What to Include)
When reporting, please include:
- Your contact information (optional)
- Names of individuals involved and their roles
- When and where the incident occurred (links, timestamps)
- Any additional context or relevant details (e.g., screenshots)
We do not require a reporter to engage with the alleged offender.

## Appeals
If you believe a decision was made in error, you may appeal by emailing **conduct@<your-domain>** with a concise rationale. Another maintainer or advisor not involved in the original decision will review the appeal.

## Commitment to Privacy, Safety, and Accessibility
- **Privacy:** Never post PHI/PII or other sensitive data in issues, PRs, or logs.  
- **Safety:** Respect our advice/safety policies; do not encourage harmful or risky behaviors.  
- **Accessibility:** Follow WCAG-aligned practices in UI, docs, and examples; prefer plain language and predictable flows.
